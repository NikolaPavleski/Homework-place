            </summary>
            <p>The selection of websites featured on Frontend Practice is based on personal preference and takes into consideration various factors, including design and style, difficulty to recreate, and elements and features that offer a learning opportunity through recreation.

                It is important to note that some projects may be more challenging to recreate than others.</p>

            <p>We encourage you to make these projects your own by incorporating your own colors, content, and images. If you choose to use these projects for your portfolio, please clearly state that it is an "unofficial" version.

            <p>How dare they update the website! We will talk with their manager right away. If they don't respond, we'll periodically check the websites we feature and make the necessary updates.

                In some cases, if we really love the previous design, we may keep it and link to an archived page if possible. If not, please see the reference image on the project page.</p>

            <p>Occasionally we will retire projects from the main collection if the design is no longer up to date or an archived version is not available.
