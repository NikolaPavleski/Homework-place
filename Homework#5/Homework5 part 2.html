    <h1>The naked mole rat</h1>

    <p>The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber), also known as the sand puppy,[6] is a burrowing rodent native to the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, notably in Somali regions. It is closely related to the blesmols and is the only species in the genus Heterocephalus.[7]</p>

    <h2>Physiology</h2>

    <p>The naked mole-rat is well adapted to the limited availability of oxygen within the tunnels of its typical habitat. It has underdeveloped lungs and its hemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen, increasing the efficiency of oxygen uptake.[14][15][16] It has a very low respiration and metabolic rate for an animal of its size, about 70% that of a mouse, thus using oxygen minimally.[17] In response to long periods of hunger, its metabolic rate can be reduced by up to 25 percent.[15]</p>
    <p>However what sets them apart from other rodents is their resistance to cancer and longevity compared to other rodents. They can live up to 37 years old</p>
