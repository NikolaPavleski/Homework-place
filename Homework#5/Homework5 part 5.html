    <h1>The red lipped batfish.</h1>
    <p>The red-lipped batfish or Galápagos batfish (Ogcocephalus darwini) is a fish of unusual morphology found around the Galápagos Islands and off Peru at depths of 3 to 76 m (10 to 249 ft) (Froese, Rainer; Pauly, Daniel 2016)[2]. Red-lipped batfish are closely related to rosy-lipped batfish (Ogcocephalus porrectus), which are found near Cocos Island off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. This fish is mainly known for its bright red lips. Batfish are not good swimmers; they use their highly adapted pectoral, pelvic and anal fins to "walk" on the ocean floor. When the batfish reaches maturity, its dorsal fin becomes a single spine-like projection (thought to function primarily as a lure for prey).</p>

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>The red-lipped batfish was first formally described in 1958 by the American ichthyologist Carl Leavitt Hubbs with its type locality given as Tagus Cove on Isabela Island (Eschmeyer, William N.; Fricke, Ron & van der Laan, Richard, 2024)[3]. The genus Ogcocephalus is classified within the "Eastern Pacific/Western Atlantic clade" of the family Ogcocephalidae (Derouen, Ludt, Ho, Chakrabarty, 2015)[4]. The family Ogcocephalidae is classified in the monotypic suborder Ogcocephaloidei within the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes in the 5th edition of Fishes of the World (Nelson, Grande, Wilson, 2016)[5]</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The red-lipped batfish reaches up to 40 centimetres (16 in) in length (Froese, Rainer; Pauly, Daniel 2016)[2]. Its body color is light brown and a greyish colour on its back (though not very visible in sea), with white countershading on the underside. On the top side of the batfish, there is usually a dark brown stripe starting at the head and going down the back to the tail. The snout and horn of the red-lipped batfish is a brownish color. As the name of the fish states, the batfish has bright, almost fluorescent, red lips. The color of the squamation of the red-lipped batfish is shagreen-like with a relatively smooth texture. The bucklers are concealed by a layer of fine spinules.</p>
